I am a student.

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [Yihui](http://yihui.name/) by Yihui(Thanks a lot!). 

You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.

I like open source software like:

- [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
 
- [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/): 


You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonduan/) . Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../feed/) or [all comments](http://snowdj.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned.
