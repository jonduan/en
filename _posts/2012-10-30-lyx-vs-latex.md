I use Lyx for Latex the same as many people in our department. I mainly use sublime for markdown and text files. 

There is interesting slide about ["Emacs Has No Learning Curve"](http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/emacs-ess/emacs-ess.pdf) or https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/2012-August/008067.html

Now I rather use Rstudio and knitr.
