I am R user. I am pretty fond of the beauty of R.

I am also a Matlab and Python user.

Then I find Julia has features of R, Python, and Matlab.

MIT has a tutorial about Julia as well. https://github.com/stevengj/julia-mit/blob/master/README.md

I hope I can Julia can meet most of my need for scientific computing.

I am supprised that there are Julia Studio like Rstudio and IJulia Notebook like IPython Notebook.

[Julia Studio](http://forio.com/labs/julia-studio/) is still very simple and is not nice as Rstudio.

But IJulia Notebook is pretty. It is based on IPython Notebook.
    IJulia is a Julia-language backend combined with the IPython interactive environment.
