I want to be a researcher, and start to learn programming for statistics and writing (latex). 

I find [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) gives a lot of good advices. I even find many statisticians support this project. Thousands thanks for those great people.There is good video about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA
