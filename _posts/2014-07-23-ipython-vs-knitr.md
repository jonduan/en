## ipython and knitr

I am econometrics student. I first learned R and knitr, and then I learned a little Python and IPython notebook. They are similar. I am wondering why smart people usually have the same idea.  

I just find that I can use R and Octave in IPython notebook.
[Rpy](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html)
[Octpy](http://blink1073.github.io/oct2py/docs/)

There is [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=F4rFuIb1Ie4&list=WL#t=2107) show how we can do it.

If R is not flexilbe as Python does, I may transfer to Python.
