## ipython and knitr

I am econometrics student. I first learned R and knitr, and then I learned a little Python and IPython notebook. They are similar. I am wondering why smart people usually have the same idea.  

I just find that I can use R and Octave in IPython notebook.

If R is not flexilbe as Python does, I may transfer to Python.
